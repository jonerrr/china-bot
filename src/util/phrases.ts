  `Your social credit system (社会信用体系) score has been deducted by _

  What does this mean?
  Your social credit rating (out of 8) on the now fully-functioning social credit system has been reduced.
  
  Why did you do this?
  There are several reasons your social credit score may have been reduced. You may have shown extremist tendencies such as having a sense of humour, voicing your own opinions and objecting to xinnie the Pooh’s our great comrade and leader Xi Jinping’s rule and corruption, showing a visible lack of brainwashing education which could demonstrate a lack of loyalty to the sublime party & make you more vulnerable to western lies & propaganda such as the Uyghur genocide & the Hong Kong protests, alongside regular conspiracies such as “Taiwan”? Plus many other reasons for the party to harbour potential worries about your loyalty to this brilliant nation.
  
  Am I banned from the one and only China?
  No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I, this AI produced in part by Huawei, Ant group and Alibaba group in coordination with the Chinese government, will be forced to issue an additional social credit score deduction, which may put your commenting on all Chinese-monitored social media platforms and posting privileges in jeopardy. Should this continue, your social credit score will limit your social capabilities from being able to purchase public transport to being able to leave your own home, and soon enough you may magically disappear.
  
  I don’t believe I deserve a social credit reduction. Can this be reversed?
  No. A computer only does what you tell it to do. And Alibaba, Huawei and the Chinese government as well as Ant group have decided to program the algorithm for the social credit system to work exactly as it has done. In fact this demonstrates how uneducated and trustless you are that you are doubting the party itself. Your score will be reduced even more instead.
  
  How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
  Accept the reduction and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated by the wan and only China. We will continue to issue score reductions until you improve your conduct. Remember: Chinese spyware is privilege, not a right.`,
